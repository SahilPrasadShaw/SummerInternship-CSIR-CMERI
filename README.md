 This report discusses the summer technical internship program for a period of 30 days (18th June, 2024 to 16th July, 2024) in CSIR-CMERI, Durgapur, West Bengal. 
 This report describes about the casting and the processes involved in producing components through melting and casting route. 
 It provides an overview of the metal casting process including the different types of casting
 processes like sand casting, investment casting, die casting, and others. 
 It discusses key aspects of sand casting like the design elements, properties of molding sand, and methods of sand testing. 
 It also covers topics like cores and core materials, furnaces, inspection and testing of castings. 
 Hardness Test, Metallography and Microstructures analysis of various metal and alloys.
 Simulation on SOLIDCast, a casting simulation software program which can simulate filling and solidification process of a casting. 
 It assists the user to visualize the solidification process of a particular casting. 
 The main goal of the report is to provide an easy-to-understand overview of the metal casting process, its applications, and related testing and quality control methods.
